** This is a QMUL MSc assignment that contains a computer vision (CV) model for identifying plants body parts **

The notebook holds four types of neural networks (NN):
1) Basic Neural Network (23 minutes to train)
2) Small Neural Network (13 minutes to train)
4) Big Neural Network (45 minutes to train)
5) Convoluted Neural Network (2 hours to train)

The model was trained on CPU

Version of python and supporting libraries:
- Python: 3.10.11
- Tensorflow: 2.18.0
- Numpy: 2.0.2
- Pandas: 2.2.3
- Matplotlib: 3.10.1
- SKLearn: 1.6.1
- SciPy: 1.15.2
- rdata: 0.11.2

All of the models are trained using the KewMNIST dataset (not publicly available)
